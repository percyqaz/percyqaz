## ðŸ’¡ An unfinished project is just a project you haven't **finished yet**

I like making things, useful or not so - it's the fastest way to find out if it's useless!

    <h2>âš¡ Percyqaz.Flux</h2>
  </summary>

  With originally almost no knowledge on writing a game engine, after about 4 years of engineering effort I now have a game engine with:
  - General purpose rendering
  - Text rendering
  - Keyboard input
  - Precise audio playback (built for rhythm games in mind)
  - A full GUI toolkit

  It is entirely written by me (except for lower-level things like image/audio decoding, windowing and OpenGL bindings)

  It may not be the most powerful or elegant, but it's mine and suits the projects that use it perfectly.

    <h2>ðŸ’¬ Untitled Minecraft Server Project</h2>
  </summary>
  Not on my GitHub (predates it), it's somewhere on one of my old computers somewhere and worked for a much older version of Minecraft back in 2015/16

  How it started:
  - Launching the Minecraft Dedicated Server software as a subprocess in a python script
  - Redirecting the stdin and stdout to the python script
  - Writing an full API and plugin layer over parsing things from the logged output and automatically sending commands into the server command line
  - Creating a custom UI to overview the server instead of the default window

  Things I eventually made:
  - A bridge between the ingame chat and an IRC channel (that was also bridged to a Terraria server)
  - Patching the server's java code to have it log even more things for my API
  - Patching the server with a custom world generator modification (also written by me)
  - Various equivalents to conventional minecraft plugins such as teleport points, quests, an economy
