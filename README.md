I work professionally in C#, and to not *completely* lose my sanity, I use a completely different stack (F# and others) for my hobby projects. 
Unfortunately you probably don't read or write F#, so you'll just have to take my word for it that I do a good job

Take a look at some stuff I've done:

- ["Interlude", part of my 'Yet another vertically scrolling rhythm game' project](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude)
- [Advent of code 2023](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2023)
- ["Ultimate Inventory" Minecraft plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimate-inventory-1-19.109298/)

I'm eyeing up Rust as my language of choice for future projects due to it getting nearly everything right, but honestly F# 8 delivers on fixing some things that annoyed me the most about it and so F# remains the language I am happiest writing right now

People often ask me for a starting point when it comes to learning programming languages - My honest recommendation is learning [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) first because it's awesome
