## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Percyqaz and I enjoy most things code

Most of my projects are personal tools or solutions I've created for myself  
I like to release them to the public for the two-way benefits of feedback and bug reports for me while you get useful free software

I currently work professionally in C#, and I use mostly F# outside of work  
I generally recommend using different stacks, IDEs, color schemes in and out of work to protect your sanity - I often pull 20-30 hours a week on hobby projects on top of my job

Currently solidifying my foundations to ensure I have a long-lasting successful career in software

## âœ¨ Take a look at some of my projects

- ["Interlude", part of my 'Yet another vertically scrolling rhythm game' project](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG)
- [Advent of code 2024](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2024)
- ["Ultimate Inventory" Minecraft plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimate-inventory-1-19.109298/)

## ðŸ”¥ Some of my hot takes
- Scala is the only language I've looked at that appears not committed to a gimmick that slowly drags you down
  
  If you want to learn programming, I recommend [learning it](https://scala-lang.org/) second after the [popular](https://www.python.org/) [choices](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) because it's awesome and has a bit of everything
- F# is my current language of choice - I dislike much of the syntax but it sure is lightyears ahead of its peers when it comes to utility
- I sense a lot of Zig in my future, when it's a bit more mature

## ðŸ’¡ An unfinished project is just a project you haven't finished yet
