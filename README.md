  That's quite a mix of languages, mostly because of [something I did in December](https://github.com/percyqaz/advent-of-code-2022)

Personal opinion tier list of languages (based on how useful they are to me):

| Rank | Language | Notes             |
| :--- | :------: | :---              |
| #1   | F#       | It's my favourite |
| #2   | Python       | Useful for executing your code 10 seconds into writing it |
| #3   | TypeScript       | Still learning, likely to take #2 or even #1 |
| #4   | C#       | I have my disagreements |
| #5   | Java       | Like C#, only more so |
