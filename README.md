## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Percyqaz and I enjoy most things code  

Most of my projects are personal tools or solutions I've created for myself  
I like to release them to the public for the two-way benefits of feedback and bug reports for me while you get useful free software

I currently work professionally in C#, and I use mostly F# outside of work  
I generally recommend using different stacks, IDEs, color schemes in and out of work to protect your sanity - I often pull 20-30 hours a week on hobby projects on top of my job

Currently solidifying my foundations to ensure I have a long-lasting successful career in software

## âœ¨ Take a look at some cool things I maintain

- ["Interlude", part of my 'Yet another vertically scrolling rhythm game' project](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG)
- [Advent of code 2023](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2023)
- ["Ultimate Inventory" Minecraft plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimate-inventory-1-19.109298/)

## ðŸ”¥ Some of my hot takes
- Scala is the only programming language I've looked at that appeared not to be committed to some gimmick that slowly drags you down as you use it for general purposes
  If you want to learn programming, I recommend trying [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) second after the popular choices because it's awesome and has a bit of everything
- F# is my current language of choice - I dislike much of the syntax but it sure is lightyears ahead of its peers when it comes to utility
- I sense a lot of Zig in my future, when it's a bit more mature

## ðŸ’¡ An unfinished project is just a project you haven't finished yet
