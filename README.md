## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Percyqaz and I enjoy most things code  

Most of my projects are personal tools or solutions I've created for myself  
I like to release them to the public for the two-way benefits of feedback and bug reports for me while you get useful free software

I currently work professionally in C#, and I use mostly F# outside of work  
I generally recommend using different stacks, IDEs, color schemes in and out of work to protect your sanity - I often pull 20-30 hours a week on hobby projects on top of my job

Currently solidifying my foundations to ensure I can have a long-lasting successful career in software

## âœ¨ Take a look at some cool things I maintain

- ["Interlude", part of my 'Yet another vertically scrolling rhythm game' project](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG)
- [Advent of code 2023](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2023)
- ["Ultimate Inventory" Minecraft plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimate-inventory-1-19.109298/)

## ðŸ”¥ Some of my hot takes
- Rust is the best programming language hands down, IF
  - You have no time limit
  - You're OK doing half of your project from absolute scratch bare metal
- OOP actively obstructs you from modelling simple problems in their simplest form. I dread "modelling the real world" in Java or C#
- F# is my current language of choice - I dislike much of the syntax but it sure is lightyears ahead of its peers when it comes to utility
- If you want to learn programming, I recommend [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) first because it's awesome and has a bit of everything

## ðŸ’¡ An unfinished project is just a project you haven't finished yet
