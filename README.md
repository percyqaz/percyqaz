I work professionally in C#, and to not *completely* lose my sanity, I use a completely different stack (F# and others) for my hobby projects. 
Unfortunately you probably don't read or write F#, so you'll just have to take my word for it that I do a good job

Take a look at some stuff I've done:

- ["Interlude", part of my 'Yet another vertically scrolling rhythm game' project](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude)
- [Advent of code 2022](https://github.com/percyqaz/advent-of-code-2022)
- ["Ultimate Inventory" Minecraft plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimate-inventory-1-19.109298/)

I think any new projects I start from now on will be using Rust due to it being the superior language (I'm part of the cult now)
